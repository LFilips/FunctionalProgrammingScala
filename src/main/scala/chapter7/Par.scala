/**
  * The main idea is to create an api that will allow to do parallel computation. Let's take as example the sum
  * of all the integer of a list, this can be easily achieved using the fold right function.
  * But what if we want to do this with many threads? how we can do that? How that can be done in a pure functional approach?
  * Instaed of using the fold function we can use a recursive approach, where we split the list in two and then we sum the
  * result again:
  * val (l,r) = list.splitAt(length/2)
  * sum(l) + sum(r)
  *
  * For doing this, we need to wrap this sum operation in out parallel operation, that can be for example Par[A], that
  * holding a generic type can hold everything.
  * The first definition is about a Unit and a get. The unit will be the creation operator for our data type, and get
  * will be the method that we use for getting data from it. The only problem is that we have to decide where the
  * actual calculation of the data will occurr, if directly in the unit or when the get is called.
  *
  * This is an example of how it can be implemented:
  *
  * * val sumL = Par.unit(sum(3))
  * * val sumR = Par.unit(sum(2))
  * * Par.get(sumL) + Par.get(sumR)
  *
  * In this case we have two different solution:
  * 1) starting evaluating the sum when the unit is created
  * 2) Delay the evaluation of the param until get is called
  *
  * If we want any degree of parallelism we need unit to begin to evaluate the value immediatly otherwise since the
  * function argument are evaluated left to right we will run sumR always after sumL, since we will block for the get
  * to have some value. But what happen if we start to evaluate everything immediatly in the Unit? That we break the
  * referential transparency, because if we substitute with the method notation:
  *
  * Par.get(Par.unit(sum(l))) + Par.get(Par.unit(sum(r)))
  *
  * we will have a sequential computation, because each get will wait for the result!
  * The referential transparency is broken only with regard of get, so until we are not calling it we are not in trouble.
  *
  * So the assumption is that the unit will not longer do the computation but will be the get to take care of that, the unit
  * will be used to create a unit of computation, that we will be able to combine and manipulate.
